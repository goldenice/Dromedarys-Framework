Dromedarys Framework
=============

It's a Hack framework, and it's utterly simple.
It works.

The cool thing is, it supports both native PHP and Hack code. It does have to run in the HipHop Virtual Machine though.

It hasn't got it's own documentation, but it is based on [Kamele Framework](https://github.com/goldenice/Kamele-Framework), so most of that is applicable to Dromedarys.
